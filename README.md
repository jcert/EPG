# EPG

This repository complements the paper titled "...", and accommodates Julia files for simulating a epidemic compartmental model coupled to a population game.

## Concept
Join the dynamics of an SIRS model and Population games,...


## Requirements
- Julia 1.6
- (*optional*) jupyter-notebook 6.2

## How to
following the [guide on environments](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1.2/environments/), you can open Julia in a terminal
press `]` to access the package manager, type `activate .` and then `instantiate`. After installing all the required software you can press backspace to exit the package manager, now you should have all the required libraries to run the code. To run the code either use Jupyter notebook for the interactive plot or open Julia and then type `include("SIRS\_EDM.jl")` to run that file.

## SIRS\_EDM.jl
File to generate all the plots used


## SIRS\_EDM.ipybn
Jupyter Notebook file with an interactive plot, in it you can change the parameters of the game and epidemic disease
